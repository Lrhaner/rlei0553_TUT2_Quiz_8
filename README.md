## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
**Our group chose a Mondrian painting as the material for the assignment. The colorful grids and lines reminded me of the Snake game. I want the first colored grid on each line to move along the line path, and when it reaches the position of each subsequent colored grid, it changes to the corresponding color. When clicked, the original painting can be displayed. Several large squares in the artwork remain in place like obstacles in the Snake game, perhaps changing colors regularly with clicks. This allows the Mondrian painting to move but maintain its original style and tone.**

### Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration 
**This code causes the squares to move in a straight line, turn when clicked, and "eat" the target square, creating the effect of a Snake game. When making our coding, we can learn from this code, divide the fragments in advance, cancel the steering interaction when clicking, and then add the restriction of fixed point color change to achieve the desired effect.**
