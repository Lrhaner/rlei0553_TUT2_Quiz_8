## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
**Our group chose a Mondrian painting as the material for the assignment. The colorful grids and lines reminded me of the Snake game. I want the first colored grid on each line to move along the line path, and when it reaches the position of each subsequent colored grid, it changes to the corresponding color. When clicked, the original painting can be displayed. Several large squares in the artwork remain in place like obstacles in the Snake game, perhaps changing colors regularly with clicks. This allows the Mondrian painting to move but maintain its original style and tone.**
